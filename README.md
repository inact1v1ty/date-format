# date-format

### TODO:

- [ ] Long formatters
- [ ] Localize preprocessors (needed for French, see [date-fns#1391](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/1391))

### License

Despite the fact that I would like to make this crate MIT or Apache-2.0, it is heavily based on JS package [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), so I consider it a derivative work and keep MIT license with proper attribution to original authors.
